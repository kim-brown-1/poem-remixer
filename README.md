# poem-remixer

Remix poems from your favorite poets! 

### Overview 

This is a fun, small python project using python's tkinter GUI library and the free PoetryDB API. 

Select a poet from the dropdown, and it will randomly pick three lines from some of their poems - it just might generate 
something amazing! 

Save the poems you like to a local txt file. 


### Upcoming features
- Aesthetic improvements to UI
- Re-generate any line of the poem
- Give generated poems a custom name
- Remix poems from multiple artists
- Clipboard copy functionality (with citations)
